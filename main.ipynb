      "CONTENT: By Pooja Toshniwal PahariaReviewed by Benedette Cuffari, M.Sc.Jul 7 2024 In a recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine , researchers examine the potential of neuromuscular training to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy .\n",
      "To date, there is no effective preventative against CIPN. Nevertheless, exercise and neuromuscular stimulation therapies, such as whole-body vibrations and sensorimotor training , have successfully addressed the sensory and motor symptoms of CIPN and reduced the frequency of falls and injuries. Study participants were randomized to the SMT, WBV, or treatment as usual groups, which comprised 55, 53, and 50 patients, respectively. In addition to standard care, the intervention group underwent supervised WBV or SMT twice weekly for 15-30 minutes.\n",
      "Patients were evaluated before chemotherapy and 12 weeks and 10 days after their final treatment. Longer therapy durations resulted in an interim analysis at week 12 and a review within ten days. Reduced mortality in the SMT group was statistically significant as compared to the TAU group. SMT outperformed TAU in terms of monopedal and bipedal balance control with participant eyes open or closed, vibration sensitivity, calf muscle strength, touch sensing, burning sensation, pain reduction, chemotherapy dosage decrease, and mortality.\n",

      "CONTENT: By Pooja Toshniwal PahariaReviewed by Benedette Cuffari, M.Sc.Jul 7 2024 In a recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine , researchers examine the potential of neuromuscular training to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy .\n",
      "To date, there is no effective preventative against CIPN. Nevertheless, exercise and neuromuscular stimulation therapies, such as whole-body vibrations and sensorimotor training , have successfully addressed the sensory and motor symptoms of CIPN and reduced the frequency of falls and injuries. Study participants were randomized to the SMT, WBV, or treatment as usual groups, which comprised 55, 53, and 50 patients, respectively. In addition to standard care, the intervention group underwent supervised WBV or SMT twice weekly for 15-30 minutes.\n",
      "Patients were evaluated before chemotherapy and 12 weeks and 10 days after their final treatment. Longer therapy durations resulted in an interim analysis at week 12 and a review within ten days. Reduced mortality in the SMT group was statistically significant as compared to the TAU group. SMT outperformed TAU in terms of monopedal and bipedal balance control with participant eyes open or closed, vibration sensitivity, calf muscle strength, touch sensing, burning sensation, pain reduction, chemotherapy dosage decrease, and mortality.\n",
