      "\n",
      "CONTENT: Blackwire Designs, a distributor in custom installation and Pro AV markets, and Integrated Fiber Platform (IFP Connect), the fiber-optics solutions provider, have announced that the IFP Connect product line will now be available via the Blackwire website to residential and commercial systems integrators.\n",
      "Founded in 2022 by industry veteran and system integration expert Eric Crawford, IFP Connect was created to address the common challenge of integrators installing over-extended category cables for their network or installing fiber and leaving it “dark” for future use.\n",
      "Related: IFP Connect Expands Product Range with Rack Mount Components\n",
      "With IFP, integrators install single-mode fiber and low-voltage power cables to achieve superior network speeds, both now and in the future. Prewiring with a single fiber cable instead of multiple category cables saves valuable on-site labor time, ensures network performance is not compromised by the limitations of category cable, and future-proofs installations for increasing speed demands over fiber.\n",
      "“We are excited to offer IFP Connect to our customers,” said Kevin Luther, owner of Blackwire Designs. “We believe that innovative fiber solutions and products like those from IFP Connect not only advance our industry but also create new profit opportunities for our dealers. By integrating these cutting-edge technologies, we are empowering our dealers to deliver superior network performance and future-ready solutions to their clients.”\n",
      "The IFP Connect product kit approach makes it easy and flexible for integrators to plan their network infrastructure designs and place orders for IFP. A single-SKU, eight-port fiber switch and power kit are required for all projects, with a trio of single-gang fiber transceiver wall plates and PoE fiber transceivers available in four-pack kits. A surface-mount one-port fiber transceiver is also available. Power supplies are included as necessary.\n",
      "“We are thrilled that Blackwire is offering IFP Connect products to its dealers,” Crawford said. “Our companies share a commitment to innovation and top-notch customer service, and this partnership will help integrators achieve even better results.” The IFP product line is now available on the Blackwire website. The IFP products will be showcased at the Blackwire Booth 3537 at CEDIA Expo 2024, Sept. 5-7 in Denver.\n",
